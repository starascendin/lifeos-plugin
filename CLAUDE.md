this is my personal k3s cluster deployed to hetzner

Locally, i am running this on my mac air m1.
Hetzner clusters are amd64

- when you build images, make sure to use amd64



for the control plane development:
- this is first and for most gonna be used in mobile. So design for mobile DX/UX first
- streamline UX as much as u can. I do not want too many clicks like modals, etc.
