for the A1 level, i want a button or a way to generate dynamic content based on the materials of A1, or a for a specific A1 lesson module.
User can enter a scenario that they care about, and the content is genreated via AI. We persist these dynamically generated content for the user, so they can review them.

One of the key thing users want is to able to generate content (conversations with someone), and they can drill on them and actually practice "speaking". These conversations are what the user will actually use in their daily life. These are drilling for all of A1, or specific A1 lesson module.

For now, we should create a separate "screen" to handle all this, inside the A1 lesson screen.
