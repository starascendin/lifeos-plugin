Executive Summary
This roadmap outlines the implementation of Kortex as Mindworks' unified workspace for deal flow management, knowledge management, and operational reporting. The platform will consolidate existing workflows from Notion, NotebookLM, and spreadsheets into a single AI-powered system.


Project Timeline
Development Rhythm
We follow a cycle-based development approach to ensure consistent delivery and transparency:

1 Cycle = 2 Weeks of focused development
Every Cycle = 1 Release with a set of completed features shipped to production
Cycle Backlog: Each cycle has a prioritized backlog of features to build, bug fixes, and improvements. As each release is completed, I pull the next set of items from the backlog based on priority and stakeholder feedback.
End-of-Cycle Review: At the end of each cycle, I will host a virtual feedback session where I demo the new features and the team can:
Join live to see the demo and provide feedback
Submit feedback asynchronously if unable to attend
Report bugs, request changes, or suggest improvements

This means you'll see new features in production every 2 weeks, with a built-in feedback loop to ensure I'm building the right things.

Phase Overview
Phase 0: Requirements Gathering (Cycle 1 | 2 weeks)
Objective: Understand current workflows, collect requirements, and prepare for implementation.

Activity
Stakeholder
Deliverable
Deal flow management pipeline & founder scorecard design & dashboard to overview deal data eg. pass reason distribution etc.
Stefanie
8-stage workflow documentation, founder evaluation rubric
NotebookLM requirements
Davis, Sid
Spreadsheet & search specifications
Finance systems assessment
Wong
Integration requirements
Portfolio reporting needs
Barry
LP report specifications
Data migration assessment
All
Migration plan & timeline
Files inventory
All
Document types & formats used by each stakeholder
Systems inventory
All
Current tools & systems used by each stakeholder

Phase 0 Deliverables
By the end of Phase 0, I will produce a comprehensive Requirements Package for each workstream:

Workstream
Deliverables
Deals Pipeline
Requirements spec, sample deal data for testing, Notion export, scorecard rubric design
NotebookLM Enhancements
Requirements spec, sample spreadsheets & documents for testing, search use cases
Finance & Reporting
Requirements spec, system credentials & API access, report templates, sample data
Portfolio Reporting
Requirements spec, LP report templates, portfolio company data samples, submission workflows


Each package includes: Requirements spec, test data, system/API credentials, and workflow documentation.

Phase 0 Exit Criteria:

All stakeholder interviews completed
Requirements Package delivered for each workstream
Test data collected and organized
System access and API credentials obtained
Phase 1 backlog prioritized and ready


Phase 1: Building Foundation (Cycles 2-7 | 4-12 weeks)
Objective: Build MVP for all workstreams in parallel. Validate requirements and ensure MVP is satisfactory to each stakeholder. Lock down MVP scope.

Note: The features listed below are preliminary. Detailed specifications, acceptance criteria, and additional requirements will be finalized based on the Phase 0 Requirements Package for each workstream. Feature requests and feedback are expected during this phase—by end of Phase 1, we will agree on and lock down the MVP requirements.
Parallel Workstreams

Owner
MVP Scope
Phase 0 Inputs
Deals Pipeline
Stefanie
8-stage pipeline, founder scorecard, document management
Requirements spec, Notion export, scorecard rubric
NotebookLM Enhancements
Davis, Sid
Spreadsheet support, cross-org notebooks, unified search
Requirements spec, sample files, search use cases
Finance & Reporting
Wong
System integration, quarterly reports, NAV compliance
Requirements spec, API access, report templates
Portfolio Reporting
Barry
Data collection, LP report automation
Requirements spec, LP templates, data samples


Phase 1 Exit Criteria:

MVP requirements locked down and agreed upon
All stakeholders have tested their MVP features and approves
feedbacks are address and/or pushed to future phases


Phase 2: Iteration & UI/UX (Cycles 8-9 | 4 weeks)
Objective: Refine the product based on real usage. Improve UI/UX and address additional feature requests.

UI/UX improvements based on user feedback
Additional feature requests (prioritized)
Performance optimization
Workflow refinements
Enhanced AI capabilities (if requested)

Phase 2 Exit Criteria:

UI/UX feedback addressed
Priority feature requests implemented
Users comfortable with daily workflows


Phase 3: Final Polish & Handoff (Cycles 10+ | Remaining)
Objective: Ensure all stakeholder requests are addressed and all functions work seamlessly.

Address remaining feature requests
Bug fixes and edge cases
Cross-feature integration testing
Documentation and training materials
Knowledge transfer
Final data migration (historical data)

Phase 3 Exit Criteria:

All stakeholder requirements addressed
All functions work seamlessly together
Team is self-sufficient using Kortex
Kortex is primary workspace (not Notion/spreadsheets)


Success Metrics
Primary: Kortex becomes the primary workspace (replacing Notion, spreadsheets, NotebookLM)

Secondary (to be defined collaboratively): Deals processed, reports automated, manual entry reduced, user adoption rate


Project Communication
Primary Point of Contact: Davis Cheng

Liaison between Bryan and Mindworks team
Coordinates feedback from stakeholders
Assists with rollout and adoption
Escalates blockers or priority changes

All feedback and requests should be channeled through Davis.


Mutual Commitments
Mindworks Team
Bryan
Attend feedback sessions each cycle
Deliver working features every 2 weeks
Test new features and report issues
Provide clear status updates
Provide timely data access
Adapt to feedback and priorities
Be available for interviews/workshops
Maintain documentation



Important Notes
Iterative approach: Features are proof-of-concept—bugs will occur, prompt feedback needed
Flexibility required: Requirements may evolve based on learnings
Data migration: Start with core data, expand gradually


Next Steps
Schedule Phase 0 kickoff meeting
Set up stakeholder interviews
Collect sample data and templates
Establish bi-weekly feedback cadence



Living document—will be updated as project progresses.
