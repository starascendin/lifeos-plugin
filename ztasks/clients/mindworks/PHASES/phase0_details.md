## WhatsApp Message to Team

Hi team, I'm kicking off Phase 0 for Kortex this week.
>
I'll be scheduling 1:1 interviews with everyone over this coming 2 weeks to:
1. Understand your current workflows and pain points in detail
2. Collect sample data you work with (decks, spreadsheets, documents, etc.) so I can test the AI workflows
3. Define an MVP scope for your workstream

Please book a time on my calendar here: https://cal.com/bryan-liu-kz5lwr/45-min

I'm based in the US, so HKT mornings work best for both timezones.

Looking forward to chatting with each of you
