# Life Compass — PRD

A system to connect daily actions to who you want to become.

---

## Core Idea

```
Identities  →  Who you want to be
Areas       →  Life domains that serve that identity
Goals       →  What you want to achieve  
Projects    →  How you'll achieve it
Tasks       →  What you do today
```

Every task you complete is a vote for the person you're becoming.

## The Five Levels

### Identities
The 3-5 versions of yourself you want to embody. These are your "lives."

- Has a name ("The Athlete") and description ("I treat my body as an asset")
- Each identity can have multiple areas
- Example: "The Builder — I create things that matter. I ship, not just dream."

### Areas
Life domains that serve an identity. One identity → many areas.

- Example: The Athlete has areas: Fitness, Nutrition, Sleep & Recovery

### Goals
Qualitative outcomes within an area. What success looks/feels like.

- Has a name and description
- Example: "Feel strong and energetic — Can do 10 pullups, never winded on stairs"

### Projects
Measurable efforts with a target and deadline.

- Example: "Couch to 5K — Complete program by March 15"

### Tasks
Atomic checkbox items. The smallest unit.

- Example: "Week 1, Run 2"

---

## Progress

Progress bubbles up automatically:

```
Tasks → Projects → Goals → Areas → Identities
```

Each level shows a percentage based on completion of its children.

---

## Views

### Dashboard
Shows all identities with progress rings. Click to drill down into areas and goals.

### Focus
Daily task list. Each task shows its full chain: Identity → Area → Project.

### Weekly Review  
Summary of tasks completed, broken down by identity. Shows which identities got attention.

### Structure
Full hierarchy tree with two view modes:
- **Hierarchy**: Identity → Area → Goal → Project → Task
- **Projects**: Identity → Project → Task (with area/goal as context line)

---
