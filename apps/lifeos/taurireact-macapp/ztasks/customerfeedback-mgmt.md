Linear is great for internal planning but it breaks down pretty fast when you're trying to manage actual customer feedback at scale.

The main issue is Linear isn't built for customers to interact with. You can't really show them a public roadmap, let them upvote things, or notify them when their request ships. So you end up with this weird workflow where feedback comes in through support/sales, someone manually adds it to Linear, and then the customer never hears back unless you remember to follow up.

It works fine when you have like 10-20 customers and can keep track manually. But once you're dealing with hundreds of feedback items from different sources it becomes a mess. You lose track of who requested what, can't prioritize based on actual demand, and there's no feedback loop back to customers.

Most teams I've seen either use a dedicated feedback tool alongside Linear or they just accept that a ton of feedback gets lost. We built UserJot specifically for this reason because Linear integration was one of the top requests. Now feedback lives in UserJot where customers can see it and vote, and when we decide to build something it syncs to Linear for actual project tracking.

The question is really whether you want feedback to be internal only or if you want customers involved in the process. If it's just internal Linear is probably fine. If you want customers to see progress and stay engaged you need something else.
