This is my Lifeos app
- in there there are 2 apps:
    - background sync job app 
        - used in tauri.
        - this is the background job app, that pulls data from my youtube playlist and also my apple screentime, notes, etc.
        - goal:
            - this app exist bc i wanted a way to sync all my persoanl data (from yt, screentime, notes) into 1 place, so i can use them later in other ways.
    - lifeos app
        - use in tauri
        - this app can also be deployed to vercel as standalone webapp
        - goal:
            - this app exist bc i wanted a way to manage everything in my life -- my project, my personal data, etc -- and use AIs that can use my data.  So a AI swarm that can use my data and help me manage diff aspects of my life.
            - this is the main hub, and can have multiple ways to interact with it:
                - webapp
                - tauri app
                - rn app (in the future)
                - etc.
            - UX:
                - ideally, i can just use voice (say some things) to AI agent, and it just gives me what i asked for, like do x tasks, update data, etc.

use shadcn ui component has much as possible
