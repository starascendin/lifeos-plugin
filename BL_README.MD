Decisions:
- 1 mono repo for holaai + life os? or 1 for holaai and 1 for life os? 
    - [DECISION - 1 mono repo]case for 1 main repo -- easy to manage. I guess i can have all the diff apps in the same repo, and they can have diff UIs.
        - they prob all share many similar components, like livekit, voice capability, etc. If i do this, just need to make sure each one are clearly defined and separated
        - hola ai -- convexbackend + rnapp + tanstack -- these are 1 thing
        - lifeos -- has its own convexbackend + rnapp + tanstack -- these are 1 thing
