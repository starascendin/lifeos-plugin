description: Full life direction snapshot — North Stars, pillars, curiosities, coaching, and working memory
---

Give me a comprehensive life direction snapshot. Use the LifeOS MCP tools:

1. Call get_life_direction_summary to get the full composite view in one call

This returns: North Stars (active/exploring visions), Pillars (core life areas with latest pulse ratings), active Curiosities (top 10), pending coaching Action Items, and all Working Memory sections.

Present as a life compass dashboard:
- **North Stars**: Active visions with status and narrative summary
- **Pillars**: Each pillar with pulse rating (1-5 scale), trend direction, and status
- **Curiosities**: Top active curiosities being explored
- **Action Items**: Pending coaching action items by priority
- **Coach Notes**: Key working memory highlights (values, patterns, breakthroughs)

Use visual formatting — pulse bars, status indicators. Flag areas needing attention:
- Pillars with declining or low pulse ratings
- Stale curiosities that haven't been revisited
- Overdue action items
- North Stars without linked pillars

This is the "start here" view for any coaching or life direction conversation.
