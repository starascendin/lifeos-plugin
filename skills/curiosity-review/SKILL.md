description: Review your curiosity queue — ideas, dreams, hobbies, what-ifs
---

Show me my curiosity queue. Use the LifeOS MCP tools:

1. Call get_curiosities to get all curiosities
2. Call get_pillars to understand life context

Present the curiosity queue:
- **By Status**: Group items by status (captured, exploring, promoted, parked, released)
- **By Type**: Show counts per type (curiosity, hobby, dream, what_if, person, place, skill, experience)
- **Stale Items**: Flag curiosities in "captured" status for more than 30 days
- **Connected**: Show which curiosities are linked to pillars

Then offer to:
- Surface a random captured curiosity for reflection
- Help promote a curiosity to a project or initiative
- Park or release items that no longer resonate

Keep the tone exploratory and playful — curiosities are for possibility, not productivity.
