description: Overview of your life pillars with current pulse ratings and vision
---

Show me my life pillars dashboard. Use the LifeOS MCP tools:

1. Call get_pillars to list all life pillars
2. Call get_pillar_pulse_latest to get the most recent pulse rating for each pillar

Present a life direction overview:
- **Pillars**: List each pillar with name, icon, status, and description
- **Pulse Ratings**: Show the latest 1-5 rating for each pillar (1=dead, 5=thriving)
- **Vision**: For each pillar, show the desired feeling and vision narrative if set
- **Current Reality**: Show the honest self-assessment if set
- **Gaps**: Highlight pillars with low pulse ratings or missing vision narratives

Use a visual format — show pulse as a bar or emoji scale. Flag any pillars that haven't been rated recently.
