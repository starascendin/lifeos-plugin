the X lives I'd be awesome to live and experience:
- journalist: 
    - (Truth Behind Health)
        - go talk to organic farmers. Why? cuz i always like being in nature and farms, and the need to return to sustainability in farming is needed. This is needed to save environment because currently:
            - aquafarming is polluting the ocean
            - factory farm pollutes
            - in the US, our food is mostly GMO and factory farmed. It is evident -- our food does not have taste compared to EU, other areas
        - go talk to health professionals across all spectrum. TCM, western medicine, newest technology, Qigong, yoga, etc
